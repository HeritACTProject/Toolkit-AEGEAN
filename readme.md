# UserSense
## Introduction
Usersence is an evaluation tool providing insights into the multifaceted aspects of the User Experience utilizing software, self-report practices, and commercial devices that collect and process physiological data.
## Requirements
The commercial wearable and mobile devices that are presented in the User Manual,  are considered appropriate to obtain the data that the tool requires based on the location of the evaluation. The data necessary for tool operation are different based on the evaluation location and thus different device and software setup is required.
## Recommendations
We kindly suggest reading the Manual before use.
The evaluators should have pre-determined certain key factors of the evaluation procedure, including the evaluation type, objectives, and participantâ€™s tasks.
The evaluation duration may vary between fifteen (15) minutes to thirty-five (35) minutes, including the baseline measurement period and the number of users that have volunteered to participate in the evaluation may vary from five (5) to ten (10) to identify the most important and critical issues of the experience.
## Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the evaluator, who organizes the process and selects the utilization of the Usersence tool, to inform each participant about the recording, processing, and local storage of their data, as well as to provide the appropriate consent form relevant to the evaluation process. Also, the evaluator must delete securely and permanently the data after they have fulfilled their purpose and summarized their necessary insights about the evaluation process. The tool does not transmit any data to third parties and operates locally on the evaluator's computer to avoid disclosure of other confidential and sensitive information.
